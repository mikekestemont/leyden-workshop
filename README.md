## Installation instructions

In this section, I will guide through the necessary steps to set up your computer for the course.

### Download course materials

This workshop uses so-called "notebook" which allows you to run Python code live from within your browser. Please download the course materials by clicking on the "download ZIP" button in the right column on the following page: [https://github.com/mikekestemont/leyden-workshop](https://github.com/mikekestemont/leyden-workshop). Unzip the folder and save it somewhere in a convenient location on your computer. Below, I will assume that you unzipped this file on your desktop.

### Install Python 3

Please install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which is a package which comes with most of the functionality etc. which you will need for these workshops. Direct your browser to http://continuum.io/downloads#py35 and download the graphical installer. Double-click the downloaded file and install the Python distribution system-wide. Make sure (!) that you download **Python 3**.

### Run the Ipython Notebook

Once you have installed Python 3, open a terminal (on Linux or Mac OS X) or a command prompt (on Windows) and first cd to the directory in which you saved the tutorial. For Mac OS X users:

    cd /Users/your-user-name/Desktop/twitter-workshop-master

For Linux users:

    cd /home/your-user-name/Desktop/twitter-workshop-master

For Windows users:

    cd c:\Users\your-user-name\Desktop\twitter-workshop-master

where you need to replace your-user-name with your actual user name on your computer! Next type:

    ipython notebook

If this returns an error message such as "Command not found", please try running with:

    jupyter notebook

This will launch the jupyter notebook in your browser. Click on workshop.ipynb to open and launch the workshop materials.

### Download Sublime Text

For this workshop, you will need a decent, cross-platform text editor. I recommend installing [Sublime Text 3](www.sublimetext.com/3). Just surf to the download tab and install the editor.
